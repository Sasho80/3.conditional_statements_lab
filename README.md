01.Problem: Excellent Result
The first task of this topic is to write a console program that reads a grade (a real number) 
entered by the user and prints "Excellent!" if the grade is 5.50 or higher.

input	output	     input	output		                input	output	      input	output
6	    Excellent!	 5	    (There is no way out)		  5.50	Excellent!		5.49	(There is no way out)

02.Problem: Greater Number
Write a program that reads two integers and outputs the number of higher value between the two.

input  output	 input	output	вход	изход		вход	изход
5              3              10            -5
3	    5		  	 5		  5       10    10      5     5	

03.Problem: Even or odd
To write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and prints whether it is even or odd.
If even print "even", if odd print "odd".

input	output	input	output	input	output	input	output
2	    even		3	    odd		  25	  odd		  1024	even

04.Problem: Write a program that reads input data from the console - a password (one line of random text) and checks
if the input matches the phrase "s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd". If it matches, print "Welcome", otherwise print "Wrong password!".

input	  output	          input	          output		input	      output
qwerty	Wrong password!		s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd	Welcome		s3cr3t!p@ss	Wrong password!

05.Problem: Number 100...200
To write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and checks whether it is less than 100, between 100 and 200, or greater than 200. If the number is:

• under 100 print: "Less than 100"
• between 100 and 200 print: "Between 100 and 200"
• greater than 200 print: "Greater than 200"

input	output		             	input	output                input	output
95	  Less than 100		        120	  Between 100 and 200		210	  Greater than 200

06. Problem: Speed information
To write a program that reads a speed (real number) entered by the user and prints the speed information.
• For speed up to 10 (inclusive) print "slow"
• For speed above 10 and up to 50 (inclusive) print "average"
• For speed over 50 and up to 150 (inclusive) print "fast"
• For speed above 150 and up to 1000 (inclusive) print "ultra fast"
• For higher speed, print "extremely fast"

input	output	input	output	 input	output	 input	output		    input	output	
8	    slow		49.5	average	 126	fast		   160	  ultra fast		3500	extremely fast

06.Problem: Area of Figures
To write a program in which the user enters the type and dimensions of a geometric figure and calculates its face. There are four types of figures: 
square, rectangle, circle and triangle. The first line of the input reads the type of figure (text with the following options: square, rectangle, circle or triangle).

• If the figure is a square: a fractional number is read on the next line - the length of its side
• If the figure is a rectangle: on the next two lines read two fractional numbers - the lengths of its sides
• If the figure is a circle: on the next line read a fractional number - the radius of the circle
• If the figure is a triangle: on the next two lines read two fractional numbers - the length of its side and the length of the height to it
Round the result to 3 decimal places

вход	 изход		вход	      изход		вход	 изход		вход	   изход
square          rectangle 	17.500  circle 113.097  triangle 45.000
5	    25.000		7                   6                4.5
7               2.5                                 20
